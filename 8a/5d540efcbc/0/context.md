# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

did u index this project ?

### Prompt 2

Explore the codebase more thoroughly to understand the implementation

### Prompt 3

read the last commit and undertsan hwta chanegs we made

### Prompt 4

can we make it better ?

### Prompt 5

lets do it

### Prompt 6

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 7

install the clis try them out and then write the skills file
make u have all the information necesarry for this and dont make up your own commands

### Prompt 8

you have added my personal work dorectory here 
`/Users/agada/openclaw-ecosystem-wallet-skill/
this tool will be used by other agents to install and use this tool 
make it more genralized

### Prompt 9

ok the point of this sessio is to optiixe the skill.md file and the tool to have the best agent expeirnce 
I will paste reviews from the agent testing the tool 
and we need to keep optomizing the tool 
The issues are in @issues.md 
take a look and plan how ull fix them 
generate a concoise plan and let me review

### Prompt 10

The rid (Request ID) exists because the tool uses a "Sealed Box" (Anonymous Encryption) architecture. Here is the technical reason why the engineer included it:

1. It is a Decryption Key Pointer

When the CLI runs create-request, it doesn't just generate a link; it generates a one-time-use RSA/NaCl Keypair (Public and Private keys).

• The Public Key is sent to the browser via the link so the wallet can encrypt your session data.
• The Private Key never leaves the CLI's machine; it is saved...

### Prompt 11

commit the chnges you did till now and push

### Prompt 13

dont co author cluade , continue

### Prompt 14

also make required changes to the docs 
dont make a seperate agent froednly section 
the skills file is meant for agents 
We can write the readme file for humans 
so create a optmized context effecient skills file for this

### Prompt 15

ok what is a keytar , earlier this tool used it ,
is it exclusive to macos or not
is it better than the filw based key storage we are using now 
testing agents earlier verdict - 
Headless Environment Compatibility (keytar)

The CLI relies on keytar for session storage.

• Issue: keytar expects a system keychain (macOS Keychain/libsecret). In a headless Docker container or a sandbox, this fails or requires a mock. I had to navigate around keytar-mock.mjs to make it work.
• Recommendation: Pro...

### Prompt 16

just answer this - 
does our current skill tell the agent to use keytar ?
does keytar work on agents on a vps ?

### Prompt 17

what is the system that auto deetcts this ?

### Prompt 18

ok I want to confirm if our system uses keytar or macos keychain

### Prompt 19

The balances issue was a "double-mismatch" between the URL endpoint and the data format expected by the Sequence Indexer.

Here is the technical breakdown:

1. The Route Mismatch (404 Error)

When I first ran the balances command for Polygon, the CLI was hardcoded to use this "Summary" endpoint:
https://indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenBalancesSummary

The Problem: This specific endpoint (GetTokenBalancesSummary) does not exist or isn't enabled for a direct RPC call on the global indexer...

### Prompt 20

did u make this cahnge in the cli or was it here from before ?

### Prompt 21

ok recommed what tests I should do now which my agent  , I want to test this tool fully beaofre it can be made public , what prompts and flows should I check ?

### Prompt 24

cretae a new branch and integrate both the builder cli and the project we have now 

goal - for an agent the experince should be fully end to end 
After reding the skill file it should be able to get a wallet , create a project then also ask thre user to create a ecosystem wallet for spending 

I have selected the first flow and then the ecosystem wallet  trails and this current project kicks in

ok so the old cli is unchanged but the url for the acme wallet is returning a 404 error for both the clis which means that there is an issue with the deploued acme right ?
answer concisely

### Prompt 85

Still failing to decrypt. I ran another manual check and the result is the same.

Diagnosis:
The connector UI (at localhost:4444) is likely sealing the payload with a different public key than the one I sent in the URL, or it's using a different encryption format.

Wait—I see something. In the App.tsx file I read earlier, the connector UI uses nacl.box but the CLI uses sealedbox (NaCl Sealed Box). These are different encryption primitives.

However, you said not to fix bugs, so I'll just repor...

### Prompt 87

i am tesing using another agent and it is still givign me errors 
The wallet start-session command is still failing with a "Failed to decrypt ciphertext" error.

I've manually verified the decryption using the private key for the current request (pcry5k8f1L-Epd2vyswsRQ), and it's returning null, meaning the ciphertext was not sealed for this specific session.

might be the bot is not ingesting the blob correctly , hgow are udoig it?

### Prompt 90

is the blob genertaed fixed in length ?

### Prompt 91

ok the issue is that I am communicatio with my agent via telegram and the telegram is truncating the characters 
adn since the blob is so long it is not able to read it , what can be thr fix here 
I was thinking that instead of copying the blob we can just produce the bolb as a text file in the connector ui 
and I can direclty paste the file to the tg chat 
but i want a better method from a user expereince perspectuve 
Think of soemthing

### Prompt 92

ok I have created the ecocsytem wallet suscessfully but now i have to do some issues 

The transfer also failed with the same "No signer supported for call" error.

As I suspected, the issue is that the dapp-client doesn't recognize the recipient address (0xBBc4...) as a valid target for the current session.

Even though the session has a valueLimit for native tokens, the basePermissions in your App.tsx only explicitly mentions the ValueForwarder contract (0xABAAd93EeE2a569cF0632f39B10A9f5D73477...

### Prompt 95

### Prompt 96

The transfer command send-native failed with "Transaction failed: Request aborted".

However, looking at the debug logs from the process, I see a very specific error from the Sequence relayer:
cause: 'unable to get fee options: gas usage simulation failed...'

This happens when the relayer tries to simulate the transaction to calculate gas fees but the transaction reverts.

Why is it reverting?
It's likely because of the Permissions again. The session we created (RID: 1xWYbrL3eyp3LwD3vbk_Mw) sti...

### Prompt 98

ption 1: Webhook Callback (Best UX — zero copy/paste)
The connector UI already has partial webhook support. We extend it so wallet create spins up a temporary HTTP server, the connector UI POSTs the ciphertext directly to it, and wallet start-session auto-completes. The agent never touches the blob.

Flow:

wallet create → starts temp HTTP server on a random port, outputs URL with &callback=http://localhost:PORT/callback
User opens link in browser, approves
Connector UI POSTs ciphertext to t...
